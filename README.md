# Tictactoe
📱Description:
A fun game of tictactoe that we played as children but now digitlized ! A game that shows the workings of Parent and Children components as well as the taks of mangagning state.

🖍 Improvements and Roadmap:
I changed the color and layout of the game to make it more inviting. Further changes I would implement would be to have sound effects everytime the user clicked a box.
💻How To Run:
Simply open the HTML file in a localhost 8080 and enjoy the game !
